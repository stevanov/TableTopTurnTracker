# TableTopTurnTracker 

**T**able**T**op**T**urn**T**racker is planned to be a cheap way to add order to your board/card game nights. By installing one of the widely available addressable LED strips to your table you should eventually be able to set an amount of players, their colour of choice, optional maximum turn length and things like a set number of turns.

_Other possible features to be added later_
* Timed turn tracking or manual by use of a button on the table (wireless?)
* Web interface
* Additional lighting effects for games like DND
* Life and stat tracking?
* Dice function
* Simple hardware and hookup diagrams for inexperienced builders
